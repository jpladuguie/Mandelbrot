# Mandelbrot Set Generator

This Python program plots the Mandelbrot set through the use of parallel processing and antialiasing. Areas can be zoomed into, and variables such as the intial frame and number of iterations may be changed. Pyopencl allows it to be run both by the CPU or the GPU (if one is available), speeding up the time taken to generate the Mandelbrot set significantly.
